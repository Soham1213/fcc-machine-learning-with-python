5 Projects I did through the FreeCodeCamp.org - Machine Learning in Python course

## What I learned 
Through this course I was able to use the TenserFlow 2.0 framework to build projects to familiarize myself with Python's Machine Learning and Deep Learning tools. 
I learned the specializations and applications of Machine Learning algorithms : Regression, Classification, Generation, Computer Vision, NLP, Q-Learning through the folllowing models: CNN, KNN, RNN, and linear regression.
