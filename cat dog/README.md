# Identify Cats and Dogs
In this challenge, I used the cat and dog datasets and libraries given to me to complete code that can classify images of dogs and cats. 
I used Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras to create and train a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time.
